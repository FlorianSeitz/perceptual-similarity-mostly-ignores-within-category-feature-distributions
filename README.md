### Abstract
Categorizing objects is a fundamental human skill, which entails assigning objects to categories based on features. Within categories, the objects are distributed, meaning that in each category the object features may vary and correlate, and processing this distribution can improve categorizations. Whether people use the within-category feature distribution information to categorize objects is unclear due to mixed evidence. To investigate the role of within-category feature distributions in categorization, we designed two experiments, manipulating the variances and correlations of features within categories through simulation-based optimal experimental design. Using computational cognitive modeling in an exemplar-similarity framework, we compared a psychological process that ignores the within-category feature distributions (Euclidean similarity) to a process that considers the within-category feature distributions (Mahalanobis similarity). The experiments (both Ns = 43) clearly showed that most participants did not consider the within-category feature distributions, and their behavior is best described by the simpler Euclidean similarity. Nevertheless, a minority of participants were described by the Mahalanobis similarity, which considers the within-category feature distributions, even though their categorizations were less evident than those of the participants described by the Euclidean similarity. In sum, the results suggest that in categorization the psychological processing of similarities between objects is mostly invariant to the distribution from which the objects stem, which may be because it is computationally costly to estimate the distribution of features in categories.
